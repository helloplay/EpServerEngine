EpServerEngine
=======================
#### Visual C++ WinSock Server/Client Engine ####


DESCRIPTION
-----------

EpServerEngine is a Visual C++ software framework that supports the development of server/client application under a [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
It handles all the initialize/usage WinSock library, which is time consuming task. 
EpServerEngine supports Visual C++ 2005/2008/2010/2012.
Source can be downloaded at [EpServerEngine](http://github.com/juhgiyo/epserverengine)


FEATURES
--------

* Easy to build server/client application.
  - Just implement Packet Structure and Packet Parsing routine for your server/client, 
       and EpServerEngine will do rest for you.
  - No more nasty initialization of WinSock and painful Winsock operation 
       to build server/client application.
  - No need to spend the time for handling thread synchronization.
* Supports variadic length packets using Packet Container
* Supports full ASCII/Unicode development environment

USAGE
-----

To find the usage examples, please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/juhgiyo/EpServerEngine/wiki)


WARNING
-------

Warning: This framework is NOT free from the 10K problem, since it is creating one thread per connection. (There are many frameworks out there which use IOCP to avoid the 10K problem.) This may be sufficient for small network where performance is NOT very important( which was most of my case).
If you worry about this 10K problem, please check out [EpserverEngine.cs](https://github.com/juhgiyo/EpServerEngine.cs), which is a asynchronous light-weight IOCP TCP template server framework in C#.
